#TODO GOAL: To gain experience with the first actual workflow/pipline for the development cycle of Continuous Integration.
#TODO NOTES: This exercise will focus on the development process only. (Be sure to use the development version of the docer files.)

#This is a basic workflow to help you get started with actions
name: Docker Dev Image CI
#Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  #Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  #Allows you to run this workflow manually from the actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
env:
  DATE_STAMP: $(date +%s) #!Sets GITHUB env variable "date"
#A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
